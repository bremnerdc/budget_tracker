Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to our applications success.

Offline Functionality:

## Usage

Then, insert the name and amount of your transaction, and select whether or not it will add or subtract from your funds. For example, if you were paid today, you would add that value to your funds. 

A chart will render your transactions below.

While offline you may continue to view the application and add transactions.

When internet is detected, your total budget will update based on those transactions.

You can also run "npm i" in your terminal, and once it has finished installing, run "node server.js"
